# Getting Started

To get started with Atlantic's Traefik setup, ensure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system.

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/rutvik2611/Atlantic.git
    cd Atlantic
    ```

2. **Create a `.env` file from the example and update it with your configuration:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    nano .env
    ```



3. **Create the `backboneNetwork` Docker network:**

    ```bash
    docker network create backboneNetwork
    ```
add a step to 
touch traefik/acme.json
chmod 600 traefik/acme.json

4. **Start the Docker services:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

# Configuration

Configuration details for Traefik are managed in the `traefik/traefik.yml` and `traefik/dynamic.yml` files. Key configurations include network settings, service-specific settings, and Traefik labels for routing.

# Deployment

Deploying Traefik involves using Docker Compose to manage the container setup. Ensure that your system meets the required specifications and that you have correctly configured the `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` files.

1. **Build and start the container:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d --build
    ```

2. **Monitor the logs to ensure Traefik is running correctly:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```

# Maintenance

To perform maintenance tasks, follow these steps:

1. **Stop the Docker services:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    ```

2. **Fix permissions for `acme.json`:**

    Navigate to the `traefik` directory where `acme.json` is located and change the file permissions to 600:

    ```bash
    cd traefik
    chmod 600 acme.json
    ```

3. **Restart the Docker services:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose down
    docker-compose up
    ```
   ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```
